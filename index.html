======
Hello, I'm Shailesh Dwivedi, an accomplished Full-stack Developer with 9 years of experience in architecting and deploying scalable solutions for distributed systems. Holding a degree in Computer Science Engineering from The Institute of Engineering Technology, I continuously strive to expand my expertise beyond conventional boundaries.As a LinkedIn-certified Full-stack Developer, I pride myself on my versatility, adeptly navigating various technology stacks rather than confining myself to one. On the backend, I harness the power of Node.js, PHP, and Python, while on the frontend, I excel in crafting dynamic interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, alongside frameworks such as React.js/Redux, jQuery, and Svelte/Sapper, complemented by TypeScript.My proficiency extends to database management, having designed robust schemas on PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB. I possess a strong grasp of REST API design principles, ensuring secure communication through mastery of SSL, cookies, tokens, and more. Embracing Test Driven Development (TDD), I meticulously refine applications, resolving defects and enhancing overall software quality.Throughout my career, I've spearheaded over 30 projects, employing SDLC methodologies and cutting-edge technologies. Leading a diverse team of 10 professionals, I foster collaboration and oversee coding standards, unit testing, and analysis, ensuring seamless project execution.
